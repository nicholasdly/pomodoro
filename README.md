What started as my first individual web development project quickly grew to become a mini passion project of mine. Made by a computer science student who actively utilizes the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), Tomatera is a functional yet minimal pomodoro timer to help anyone balance their time and improve their productivity.

- Framework: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- Database: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

TODO:

- [ ] Add indicator of which timer (work or break) is active
- [ ] User authentification (keep productivity stats of individual users)
- [ ] Productivity time leaderboards
- [ ] Redesign spacing of page elements (timer should be the only thing on the screen unless you scroll down)
