I initially created Tomatera as my first individual web development project, considering at the time I was a student who actively utilized the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Since then, I've learned a lot about web development, and have migrated this project from vanilla React to SvelteKit. Now, Tomatera is a mini passion project of mine, and I am constantly looking for ways to improve it!

- Framework: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- Database: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

TODO:

- [ ] Add indicator of which timer (work or break) is active
- [ ] Collective minute count for individual days of the week (might be cool to visualize!)
